            We wanted to deliver this project fast, so we made two key decisions on how the project would unfold.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Only support SQL server features we needed
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Write as little code as possible, compose existing tech where we could

            Let's look at some of the exisitng tech used to bridge the gap between Ecto and SQL server
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently Microsoft is making moves for their software to be compatible with Linux and mac OS.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the ways they have done this is with the creation of the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server.

        <h3>Getting better...</h3>
        <img src="pictures/bridge/2.jpg">

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>
            With that in place we then looked for a pre-existing library that we can use to talk to an ODBC driver, and came up with Erlang ODBC which is part of Open Telecom Platform.

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>
            With the Microsoft ODBC Driver and Erlang ODBC in place, we have gone from needing to bridge the gap between Ecto and the SQL server binary format, to a smaller gap between Ecto and the Open Telecom Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now begins where we actually write some code.

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>
            We decided to write our implementation as two separate libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            One would be a general Elixir driver for working with SQL server, encompassing all the ODBC stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other an adaptor between that and Ecto.

        <h2>DB_CONNECTION</h2>
        <q cite="https://hexdocs.pm/db_connection/DBConnection.html">A behaviour module for implementing efficient database connection client processes, pools and transactions.</q>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>
            After looking at similar drivers (Postgres, SQLite) we knew a library called DBConnection is where we should start. This library is a behaviour module, you can think of a behaviour module as similar to an Interface class in Object Oriented Programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            DBConnection defines a set of behaviours that if implemented through callbacks provides an implementation for database connections, pools and transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used like a blueprint on how to build our driver in order to get the functionality that we wanted.
